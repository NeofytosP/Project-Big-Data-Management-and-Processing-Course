# Project Big Data Management and Processing Course

## 1. Overview 
This is a semester project for course COMP-548DL – Big Data Management and Processing


The objective as proposed was to analyze Spotify Data. To try and analyze the trends and songs' popularity in Greece/Cyprus in order to  assist in recommendation systems. But after having issues with Spark and libraries versions, as suggested by the Professor I decided to compare a MySQL schema and a MongoDB (NoSQ) schema to examine response time of different queries for Spotify Data.
